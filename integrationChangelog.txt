	standardized comment lines/removed fluff
	standardized formatting and syntax implementation
	removed redundant function prototypes where header files could be #included instead (main.c, battleUI.c, intro.c, endSim.c primarily changed)
	added cross-platform library solution for sleep() function to replace "#include <unistd.h" in any file that uses sleep():
		// Cross-Platform library solution for sleep() function
		#ifdef _WIN32 
		#include <Windows.h>
		#else
		#include <unistd.h>
		#endif
	consolidated all global variables into combat.h

main.c
	changed "char userName" to global "char USERNAME" // now can be used in other portions of UI
	changed "char pokemonChoice" to global "char PLAYERPOKEMONCHOICE" // now can be used in other portions of UI
	changed "char text1[]" string to use proper spelling "Heather Marriott" instead of "Heather Marriot"
	added functionality for player and NPC pokemon-stat readouts right before calling battleUI

starter.c
	changed "char pokemonChoicePtr" to global "char PLAYERPOKEMONCHOICE" // use of pointers is redundant with global vars
	added global "char NPCPOKEMONCHOICE"
	added functionality (inc. error-checking) for selecting opponent type, stored in NPCPOKEMONCHOICE
	implemented colored text for Pokemon names and types

starter.h
	changed "char* starter(char*);" function prototype to "char* starter();" // to support usage of non-passthrough global variable POKEMONCHOICE

generatePokemonStats.c
	changed "int pokemonChoice" to "int pokemonChoiceInt" // corrected mirrored variable name from main.c/starter.c

util.c
	changed line 17 from "milliseconds*=1000;" to "milliseconds*=100; // DEBUG: sped up for testing purposes; SHOULD BE: 1000"
	added pokemonChoiceToInt() function that converts PLAYERPOKEMONCHOICE or NPCPOKEMONCHOICE into a usable PokemonID
