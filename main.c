      - "Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting! Welcome to the world of Pokemon!
        My name is Heather Marriot. But everyone calls me the Coding Professor.
        This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokemon.
        We humans live alongside Pokemon, at times as friendly playmates,
        and at times as cooperative workmates.
        And sometimes, we band together and battle others like us.
        But despite our closeness, we don't know everything about Pokemon.
        In fact, there are many, many secrets surrounding Pok√©mon.
        To unravel Pokemon mysteries, I've been undertaking research.
        That's what I do. And you are?"

        I get it now! All right, are you ready? Your very own adventure is about
        to unfold. Take courage, and leap into the world of Pokemon where
        dreams, adventure and friendships await! First, let's choose a
        Pokemon companion!"
