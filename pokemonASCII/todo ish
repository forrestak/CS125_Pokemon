needs to replace all the / and \ with something useable
add all pokemon
probably gonna delete everything and try out new websites
https://www.text-image.com/convert/ascii.html <-- maybe this?
or i can manually fix them
escape sequences and // might be the bane of my existence :p


things to do later
so roughly 31 and 17 sized pokemons seem fine
30 width, 16 height i believe


so far, the functions arent working where there are two string inputs :/
so gotta figure that out
concat seems to be a big player in this code

so string screen is basically the gaming screen
im gonna be changing each line
basically with a function change enemy
